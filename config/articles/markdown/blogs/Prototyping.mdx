They say a single image is worth a thousand words. And if that’s true, there’s a lot more a prototype will cover. Prototypes can help you visualize and test your designs before they reach development, help you understand how users interact with your work and help you spot issues in the flow of your designs.

### When does prototyping come in handy? <a id="prototyping" />

While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some [key moments](https://google.com) in which prototyping will come in handy:

1. **Usability testing**. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live.

2. **Involving stakeholders**. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real.

3. **Impressing a client**. Prototypes can help [explain](#prototyping) or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience.

4. **Communicating your vision**. By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.

Now that we know how useful prototypes can be, it’s time to learn how to make them work.

Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.

**Low fidelity or high fidelity?** Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you’re simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.

**Consider your user.** To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing, considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right path.

Okay, so you’ve designed your prototype and it’s ready for user testing. Now it’s time to share them. With Figma, you can open your prototype in either the Mac app or the web app, and instantly copy the link to share with others. Any Viewers or Editors in your Workspace will also be able to preview your prototypes and leave feedback. You can find more detailed instructions in [our documentation](https://google.com).

And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.
